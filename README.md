PhpRules, a rules engine for Php
===================================

This engine is not my creation : it is taken from an (almost stalled) project
for CodeIgniter named PhpRules and can be found
on http://www.swindle.net/php-rules/

My work is :
* Debug (i.e Activity doesn't parse )
* Remove CodeIgniter dependancies (who can use a framework without
  namespace anymore ?)
* Move to Php 5.3 with namespaces and remove old php keywords (var...)
* Autoloader for classes
* Documentation
* Optionnaly making a bundle for Symfony2
